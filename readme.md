## Description 📝
Mai SIS is an app to create a student, staff, and course registry and track what courses are taught by whom, and who is enrolled in said course.

## Background Info ℹ️

K-12 education requires a lot of data tracking, especially in the case of audits and state reporting. Mai SIS is created in the effort to provide a more immediately intuitive means to tracking these outcomes.

Mai SIS is not necessarily doing anything new -- it's working to do it better!
